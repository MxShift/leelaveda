<img src="img/leela-game.jpg" alt="Leela Game online">
<p><strong>Life &mdash; a game in which every one of us is playing his role. In India this game is called Leela and it plays our Supreme "I", creating the world of names and forms.</strong> Before us is a working model of the game, created in ancient times and has come down to us through the Harish Johari, expert and guardian of Indian mystic traditions. The book describes in detail the numerological philosophy of Leela, no less profound and complex than the philosophy of the I-Ching, Tarot, Runes and other famous meditative and divination systems.</p>
<p><strong>Yogins, exploring the mazes of human consciousness, established the existence of the original 72 states of being. These states correspond to the game board cells Leela &mdash; "periodic system of elements of consciousness".</strong> Under these conditions, each player acts according to his karma, and the game ends only when the player is fully penetrate its meaning, reaching Cosmic Consciousness. The player throws the dice, allowing the forces of karma determine his next position on the board. He passes through the various planes of being, rising with arrows and falling with snakes, trying to understand the intention of the Supreme "I" anywhere, wherever he was.</p>

<div class="h2">Foreword</div>
<p><strong>In reality, there is only one game. The game in which each of us is an actor performing their role. This game &mdash; Leela, the universal cosmic energy game, a divine game, the inherent nature of the Supreme "I".</strong> It is this aspect owes its existence to the entire phenomenal world &mdash; the world of names and forms. Leela &mdash; it is life itself, the energy, which manifests itself in a myriad of thoughts, feelings and events taking place before the eyes of the individual.</p>
<p>The essence of the player lies in its ability to take a role to play. This entity can enter into any role, but as soon as the player enters the game, he begins to identify himself with the accepted roles and forgets his true nature. He forgets about the essence of the game, and now his movements are determined by dice corresponding karma.</p>
<p>There are times when the sunlight is suddenly illuminates the whole picture of waves and streams that make up the flow of the river, just, and pure light of consciousness pulls out from the darkness of the structure of life as a player. In these moments to the fore the nature and flow of life energy and is released. The player rises above the attachment to his role and begins to see his life as part of a larger whole.</p>
<img src="img/leela-game-free.jpg" alt="Free Leela Game">
<p><strong>The goal of this game is to help the players get rid of identification and "win" &mdash; to meet your True Self.</strong> This game reflects in microcosm the other, most of the game. The content of the seventy-two squares of the game board is the result of hundreds and thousands of years of self-knowledge. Moving from square to square, with the expansion of his understanding of the game, the player begins to realize more clearly the structure of its own existence. He sees that every state is temporary, and it weakens the attachment. Full awareness of the transitory nature of any situation destroys identification and the player goes to the free travel, learning more and more about the miracle of Existence.</p>
<p>Since the essence of the player is the ability to identify, his only chance to "win" &mdash; is to come to equate with its Source &mdash; Cosmic Consciousness, the essence of pure Being, is beyond space and time, not knowing the boundaries, eternal and unchanging, absolute and all-encompassing, not having no qualities, no form, no name. <strong>The game ends when a player becomes itself, the essence of the Game. This is Leela.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Enlightened, which opened this game, using it to understand its own state at the moment.</strong> Watching her move from plan to plan, they could see exactly what the snake lead to their downfall, and what are their arrows up. They consciously followed the pattern created by their movement on board. Passing through the game again and again, they were watching their reactions when caught on a particular field. Watching your inner space, they developed a state of non-involvement. At the same time, the structure of the game allowed them to go deeper and deeper into the divine principles and knowledge of the underlying game. <strong>It was a study of the scriptures and the study of the "I", combined in one process.</strong> Therein lies the uniqueness of Leela &mdash; the game of self-knowledge.</p>
<p>The original name of the game &mdash; "Jnana chaupada" (jnana &mdash; knowledge, wisdom; chaupada &mdash; dicing, so that the name can be translated as "The Game of Knowledge"). Seventy-two squares of playing board with all connecting them with arrows and snakes, which are seventy two main planes of existence, offer us the knowledge embodied in the Vedas. Play this game &mdash; it means in contact with the divine wisdom. This tool, which develops an understanding of the relationship of the individual "I" with the Absolute "I". Passage through the game with the preservation of this position helps the player to free themselves from the illusion, tightly enveloped his personality, and to see your life as a reflection of the macrocosm. The number that fell on the dice, the player is not determined identifications, and the interaction of cosmic forces, which, in turn, determine the development of the human life of the game. And the aim of the game is to free the human mind from the shackles of the material world and its reunion with the Cosmic Consciousness.</p>
<img src="img/leela-game-download.jpg" alt="Game Leela free download">
<p>As a drop taken from the ocean, it contains all the elements present at its source, and the human mind is a microcosmic manifestation of the Universal Consciousness. All that man can ever know or experience, is already contained within it as a potential opportunity. For all of human perception are the result of the work of the senses.</p>
<p>Events taking place in the world to excite the five sense organs (nose, tongue, eyes, ears and skin). This is accompanied by a biochemical process in the central nervous system, which manifest themselves in the form of electrical activity in various areas of the brain. This game is a reflection of the energy of one of the aspects of consciousness, called the mind.</p>
<p>The mind is the data received from the senses, intellect and ego &mdash; for assessment and action. Sensory perception are the source of all desires. And desire is the very essence of the game &mdash; who will participate in the game if he does not want to play? That desire to serve as the primary motivating force in human life.</p>
<p><strong>For understanding of the world we need to examine your own "I", studying the structure of our consciousness, recognizing the levels at which we move throughout our lives, meeting with snakes, leading us to fall, and arrows that symbolize the spiritual ascent.</strong> It is here that the game serves its highest purpose, opening before us a map of our inner states, where "One becomes many."</p>

<div class="h2">Game Idea</div>
<p><strong>In this game there is no death: there are ups and downs, there are changes in the level of vibration, but not death. Playing spirit never dies.</strong> Body &mdash; his character, which goes from one plan to another, and it is only subject to changes. Individual "I" is a limited manifestation of the Lord, the Supreme "I", the Cosmic Consciousness. The divine is in the deepest essence of each person and can not be excluded from consideration. The man is a living unity of soul and body, such as the unity of form player and his character on the game board. End of the game comes only after the Cosmic Consciousness &mdash; the eternal state, the path from which there is no return. Here the player merges with the divine existence beyond forms and qualities. This is liberation. Death &mdash; a change of form, but the spirit is always the same. <strong>Even on the material plane, there is no death, because matter neither be created nor destroyed, only possible change in the form of existence.</strong> All these changes are illusory, as a transient and a succession of states of the material world, which also serves as one of the aspects of being God, a reflection of the Supreme "I".</p>
<p>When viewed as a microcosm of the game, we will find in it a reflection of the entire octave macrocosm. And as in vivo energy moves from plane to plane, from conception to birth, from childhood to adolescence and on to adulthood and old age, and the player operates on the basis of the seven centers of psychic energy, moving up and down from chakra to chakra, accompanied by corresponding changes in his behavior on the physical level.</p>
<p><strong>Those seven planes through which the player must pass to reach the eighth &mdash; the plan is outside of all the plans &mdash; the seven chakras.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first chakra is located at the base of the spine, between the anus and the genitals.</strong> The man, who is at this level, it is usually "sure of himself and is concerned primarily with physical survival. Of the species dominates the perception of smell. Element of the first chakra is the earth &mdash; the most brutal display of reality, color &mdash; red.</p>
<img src="img/ava/1.png" alt="Leela Game: First chakra">
<p><strong>The main problem at this level &mdash; violent behavior stemming from deep-seated insecurities. But the same uncertainty can be a positive factor, which stimulates the development of material technology aimed at improving the conditions of life.</strong> People under the influence of the first chakra, and sleep for ten or twelve hours, lying on his stomach.</p>
<p>On the game board first chakra corresponds to the physical plane &mdash; the fifth box in the front row. It also applies to the entire first series, including a birth plan, Maya (illusory world perceptible), anger, greed, delusion, arrogance, greed, and sensuality. Entering the game, the participant has to go through the nine squares. At this level there are no arrows, which could raise the player to the next level, since all aspects characterizing the first chakra, is fundamental to human existence. Leaving aside the judgments and estimates made in the society, we can understand the importance of this to the person's life. However, if the player concerned with judgments of the world, he says, "Yes, angry &mdash; bad, bad to be greedy, too bad to be conceited. All this is a very bad thing. "Indeed, these elements lead to disharmony, create adverse chemical state in the body, increase self-interest, violate the inner peace and so on. But there had better remember Shakespeare: "By themselves, things can not be neither bad nor good, but our thinking makes them so." If you look at this picture deeper, then, in terms of survival (and in this direction focused consciousness in the first chakra), without attachment, without greed, without the desire for something more life stagnates. </p>
<p><strong>Do not be angry or vanity, the whole point of view would be lost. This variety of moods and passions gives life flavor and is a major driving force for the development of the individual. They are considered as something improper, they are connected with the lower, the animals start, but we can not see that they are also responsible for the development and our rational, human and divine qualities.</strong></p>
<p>Control over the release of the first chakra yogi from disease. Overcoming the main attachment, it becomes open to new knowledge and is not so concerned with self-assertion. He learns to avoid the influence of the lower desires and attachments. Tantric scriptures also say that it can become invisible, if it wants to.</p>
<p><strong>In the second chakra, the player is caught perceptions coming from the senses.</strong> This center is located in the genital area. The dominant perception is taste, the element of this chakra &mdash; water, color &mdash; orange.</p>
<img src="img/ava/2.png" alt="Leela Game: Second chakra">
<p><strong>The main problems of this level &mdash; this is the corruption and disorder, arising from the loss of energy in sensual pleasures and fantasies. But the same sensitivity is the driving force of any creative process.</strong> A person who is under the influence of the center, sleeps eight to ten hours, curled "up" &mdash; pushing his knees to his stomach.</p>
<p>The second chakra is the beginning of the two arrows: purification and charity, as well as two snakes of envy and jealousy. Here are the astral plane, plans, imagination and joy, insignificance and plan activities.</p>
<p><strong>Control of the second chakra doing yoga loved all beings. He becomes able to control the love of any man or animal and control elements. It is exempt from the enemies and shines like the sun. Such a person is masterful prose and poetry and won voluptuous desire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The main characteristic of the third chakra is the need for recognition of the ego and the desire for bodily immortality.</strong> As the fruit of the womb, a person receives food energy through the center. It is located below the navel in the solar plexus and is connected to the junction of the right and left sympathetic chains with vertebral axis. It is associated with the sympathetic nerves that control sleep and hunger. The main modality of perception is vision. The element of this chakra &mdash; the fire, and the color &mdash; yellow.</p>
<img src="img/ava/3.png" alt="Leela Game: Third chakra">
<p><strong>The main problem at this level &mdash; the abuse of their power, the will of the ego projecting on others. The positive aspect of organizational skills are related to altruistic use of its power.</strong> Anyone who is on this level, usually sleeps six to eight hours, lying on his back.</p>
<p>The third chakra relates to the divine plan and has started three arrows (on the cells of selfless service, Dharma, and charity) and a snake (in the cell of bad company). The plan also contains a field of sorrow, good company, redemption and karma. Through control of the third chakra will be free from suffering and illness, he called knowledge of the different worlds (lokas). He also possessed healing powers. This chakra stability, accumulating power, control, monitoring and worldly achievements needed to strengthen the ego.</p>
<p><strong>In the fourth chakra, the player becomes aware of the elements of his karma, his behavior and the structure of their lives. Its vibrations come now from the heart, from which grows the tree of heaven desires.</strong> Heart &mdash; the abode of the conscious principle of life and the center of prana. This chakra &mdash; at the center of the chakra system and therefore is affected by both the superior and inferior forces. Element is the air, the color &mdash; green, the dominant mode of perception &mdash; the tactile sensation of touch.</p>
<img src="img/ava/4.png" alt="Leela Game: Forth chakra">
<p>The main problem of the player at this level is that it spends too much time trying to fix the consequences of their actions, resulting in a loss of balance. Force motivating his life, becoming an active faith (bhakti). He sleeps five or six hours, lying on his left side.</p>
<p>It is the plan of balance, and the arrow that starts at the cell of the true religion, leads to higher levels of player. Snake irreligious returns players back to the illusion. Here are the plans for holiness, aromas and flavors. At this level there are also purgatory, good tendencies and clarity of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Gaining control of the fourth chakra, the yogi becomes similar to Jupiter, the lord of speech. His feelings are completely subordinated to conscious control. Adored by all women. The life of a man is filled with inspiration and poetry flowed from his mouth free flow.</strong> In the scriptures it is said that he gains the ability to move his "I" into other bodies, to become invisible, and levitate. His eyes open all worlds: the visible and invisible. Effort he can be moved to any location. He gets out of the power of time.</p>
<p><strong>The fifth chakra player imbued with compassion and wants to share with others how he managed to resolve the elements of his karma. This chakra is located in the throat, near the junction of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata.</strong></p>
<img src="img/ava/5.png" alt="Leela Game: Fifth chakra">
<p>This chakra is jnana (jnana), or knowledge. Regardless of the formal training, the player comes to the knowledge of all the scriptures, and he becomes a jnani &mdash; "knowing". <strong>It is constant, gentle, humble, brave, and free from sorrows and diseases. He is merciful to each creature and has no expectations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The main problem is authoritarianism, "I know the only right way."</strong> Outside of sense impressions, this chakra is the center of Akasa (ether), and the color of this element &mdash; blue. At this level, the player is meditating on the mantra Soham (Co &mdash; "What is It", ham &mdash; "I am"): "It is me." He hears the sound to your breathing: inhale accordance with, and exhalation &mdash; ham. His obsession is the logic and understanding &mdash; his reward. <strong>Intellect of a man freed from worldly affairs, which allows him to see the past, present and future within himself. Meditation on the throat relieve him of hunger and thirst, and he reaches the unshakable.</strong> He sleeps four or five hours, turning from side to side.</p>
<p><strong>The fifth chakra &mdash; it is a human plan.</strong> Boom Jnana and correct knowledge (suvidi) keep up the player, and the only snake on this level &mdash; is ignorance. It is a plan of positive, negative and neutral currents of life (prana, apana and Viana). <strong>Here the player is born as a man &mdash; the representative of the Supreme Consciousness, opposing animal nature, and comes to him insight into the energy of Agni &mdash; Cosmic Fire.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Control over the fifth chakra allows a person at will rejuvenate your body. His mere presence opens up to other people to the knowledge of the "I", the understanding of the mysteries of nature and the presence of the divine knowledge of every event.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The sixth chakra dominates tapas &mdash; the irrepressible desire to raise their consciousness even higher.</strong> This is the control center of the movement called Ajna chakra.</p>
<img src="img/ava/6.png" alt="Leela Game: Sixth chakra">
<p><strong>Players at this level, does not have any problems &mdash; in fact, it is beyond the capacity of any problems.</strong> It focuses on the "third eye" (in the pineal gland). He meditates on Om vibration and the sound of his breathing, which he now hears as Hamsa (ham &mdash; "I am", self &mdash; "This, That"), or "I have It." There is a difference between Soham and Hamsa: in Soham yogi still resides in the duality, he associates himself with the Supreme Consciousness, saying and feeling that it is, the Supreme Consciousness, is the "I", the individual consciousness. <strong>The sixth chakra, the duality is dissolved and in the minds of a player comes indestructible unity, the individual limit is removed and he is aware of himself as the Supreme Consciousness. He lives in this unity, meditating on its true nature. This state is beyond the elements of creation.</strong></p>
<p>Boom, starting in the cell consciousness leads player up and the snake violence carries it back to the lower levels. On this plane of self-restraint and asceticism we come to an understanding of the ida and entertained &mdash; lunar and solar channels, going back to him from the first chakra, and then go down to the nostrils, which work in the rhythm of breathing. Sushumna conducting neutral flows, rises above the seventh chakra, whose name &mdash; Sahasrara. Spiritual devotion can raise the player directly to the plan of Cosmic Consciousness. The game is the only direct way to liberation, is outside the ground (place of refuge) and liquids plan (plan point). Control of the sixth chakra gives players a huge psychic powers, and all karma acquired in this and previous lives, destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>The seventh chakra, the player goes beyond pleasure and pain. He lives in the thousand petalled lotus, which is located at the crown of the head.</strong></p>
<img src="img/ava/7.png" alt="Leela Game: Seven chakra">
<p>The scriptures say that one who claims this place gets eight supernatural powers or siddhis. They are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>anima &mdash; the ability to decrease in size,</li>
    <li>mahima &mdash; the ability to grow,</li>
    <li>Garima &mdash; the ability to increase your weight</li>
    <li>laghima &mdash; the ability to reduce your weight</li>
    <li>prapti &mdash; the ability to instantly be transported to any place,</li>
    <li>prakamya &mdash; the ability to perform any of his desires,</li>
    <li>ishititva &mdash; the ability to create,</li>
    <li>and vashitva &mdash; the ability to command all.</li>
</ul>
<p>These forces do-siddha yogi Siddha Purusha, or a perfect being. He is not limited and can do everything a wish. He did not become a passive or inert, but lives, filled with light and bliss of Higher Consciousness.But this is where they can learn self-interest, and Siddhi, are themselves the values, can be a fetter. Or Tamas (inertia) can captivate him down into the realm of illusion. Reaching the plane of reality, the player experiences the positive and negative intelligence. The latter gives rise to the serpent, returns players to the second chakra. Here are the plan of happiness, the plan of gases, a plan and the plan of the original radiance vibrations.</p>
<p><strong>Eighth horizontal row is located outside of the chakras. This is an absolute plan, the seat of the Cosmic Consciousness. Each of the nine cells located here is one of the forces of the Lord.</strong> This plan of the phenomenal world, inner space, happiness, good space, the Cosmic Consciousness, the Absolute, as well as three-phase power, manifested in the process of creation. This radzhoguna, tamoguna and sattva guna, which are respectively the positive (dynamic), negative (inert) and equilibrium. If a player does not reach the cosmic consciousness, it must once again come down to Earth and continue the game until it reaches the release. Tamoguna him back to Earth, where he fulfills his karma, moving up from sixth chakra.</p>
<p><strong>Leela &mdash; the game concluded in the very nature of the Creator and the created world is a manifestation of this game, which has neither beginning nor end. Leela &mdash; it is a great adventure and an extraordinary discovery. It is an eternal game that we play over and over and over again, without having to buy anything and nothing to lose.</strong> Anyone who is aware of the presence of the game, can not be caught playing board. He looks at what is happening as the divine Linden, who plays in front of him Leela Dhar ("Host Game", it is Cosmic Consciousness). Those who identified with the fields and plans game board, he becomes the object of the game, and it becomes a game board maya &mdash; great power, hiding the reality of mind and entangles player, maya, creating all of this diverse world of forms and phenomena. Thomas is a player in the world of maya, and boundless love and devotion to his return to the source of Cosmic Consciousness. Spiritual devotion &mdash; a huge boon for players on the field Leela created maya Higher Consciousness. They were created to enjoy playing, hiding from myself and opening myself up here and there. In this game there is no purpose or responsibility. Recall the words of Sri Ramana Maharshi:</p>
<p><strong>"Ideas goals and responsibilities for purely social nature and created by the mind of man to exhortations ego. God is above all these ideas. If He is immanent, that is present in all things, and there is nothing that would have existed without him, who here can be responsible and for whom?"</strong></p>
<p>Creation is an expression of the domestic laws inherent in the source. This internal law &mdash; the game, the inherent nature of the Divine, that is, Leela.</p>
<br>
<div class="h2">Numerology game</div>
<p>In the Indian tradition is great importance in nine main numbers from 1 to 9. Each of these numbers corresponds to a number of key characteristics that contain clues as to how subtle life force manifested in the physical world. This doctrine was brought to the West the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who studied the Arabic version of the Indian numerology.</p>
<p>In fact, the number needed not only for the bill: they also give an idea of countless power-ideas that manifest themselves in the human mind and the world of phenomena. They help the human mind to understand the ideas underlying the perceptible world. This is not a beginning of creation there is not the first, nor the last, because all is one. Numbers themselves appear only with the beginning of evolution, then to disappear again by dissolving the world in its source. Everything that exists is in the creation, in accordance with their number, every event or object are part of the whole (Brahman, the Supreme Consciousness), which manifests itself. Whole has no boundaries, no number, it incalculably it &mdash; zero, shunya (void), not-Being, which is the beginning of Leela, the cosmic play. At the beginning there is a separation of being from non-being. First appears sound, nada. Sound has two aspects &mdash; the vibration and rhythm. Vibration is energy in its primary vortex form, rhythm, in turn, is the pattern of vibrations, perceived in a linear form. Vibration creates space and rhythm &mdash; time. Each vibration is characterized by a wavelength, and the wavelength is in time, because time is a measure of its length: the length of the wave &mdash; this time from the beginning to the end.</p>
<br>
<div class="h2">Rules of the game</div>
<p>For the game requires four things: dice, game board, comment on each cell board and an object belonging to the player (eg, a ring), which will serve as his character throughout the game. The rules are simple: all participants put their characters on the cell 68, representing the Cosmic Consciousness. One by one they throw dice, passing its neighbor on the right (this corresponds to the direction of the upward flow of energy).</p>
<p>In order to enter into the game, you need to throw six points, the player moves to the cell birth and from there to the sixth cell (illusion). Until the player throws a six, he is not born in the cage of Cosmic Consciousness. Each time, at any stage of the game, when a player drops a six, he is given the right to roll again. Exception: if six drops three times in a row and the player (after going 18 cells) throws the die again and get another date, he must return to the place where he was before he began throw six, and from there go many cells, how many points was the fourth cast. If you log into the game, he throws three sixes in a row and then another number, it is returned to the first cell (birth) and counts as cell forward, how many points dropped for the fourth time. If a player throws four or more sixes in a row, it continues to throw the dice as long as not drop a number other than six, and then he goes on the number of steps equal to the total of all discarded glasses, and then passes the bone.</p>
<p>When a player lands on top of boom, it automatically rises along the shaft to its tip. If in the cell where he was, is head of the snake, it goes down to its tail. Thus, self-interest leads to the cage rage, and spiritual devotion leads to Cosmic Consciousness.</p>
<p>The goal &mdash; to return to the cage at number 68. If a player reaches the eighth series, but without hitting the cage Cosmic Consciousness, is on and stops the cells with the numbers 69, 70 or 71, it must wait until the fall or the exact number of steps separating it from tamoguny (cell 72) or a small number, allowing him to move to two or one step forward (for 69 fit 1,2 or 3 to 70 &mdash; 1 or 2 for 71 &mdash; only one). The game ends when a player lands on the cage just 68 &mdash; or an arrow from a cell spiritual devotion, or a gradual ascent, for example, cell 66, throwing two.</p>
<p><strong>During the game the player can find that again and again falls on the same arm or sting the same snake. True purpose of the game is to explore and understand the comments for each cell, explaining the meaning of each field, as well as snakes and arrows found on the game board.</strong></p>
